ViaPhpFS
=========

ViaPhpFS is a filesystem for accessing viaphpfs hosts based on FUSE and
libcurl. It automatically reconnects if the server times out. 

Requirements
============

glib-2.0
libcurl >= 7.17.0


Compilation and Installation
============================

./configure
make
make install

Usage
=====

viaphpfs <viaphpsite> <mountpoint>

ex.:
viaphpfs http://fs.example.com/index.php sunet/


Debugging
=========

viaphpfs -f -v -o debug,httpfs_debug=3 <viaphpsite> <mountpoint> 

(runs the viaphpfs in foreground and shows libcurl verbose debug output)  


Known Problems
==============

1) There seems to be a bug in libcurl 7.18 which sometimes causes problems reading files. 
Should be fixed in libcurl >= 7.18.2
