HttpostFS
=========

HttpostFS is a filesystem for accessing httpostfs hosts based on FUSE and
libcurl.

My motivation to start this project was to maintain my website using
rsync. I was using curlftpfs until I had to sync symlinks, which cannot
be created with FTP.

Requirements
============

glib-2.0
libcurl >= 7.17.0


Compilation and Installation
============================

1. (Once) Generate autotools files :
  a. Run autoheader (to generate config.h.in)
  b. Run aclocal (to generate aclocal.m4)
  c. Run libtoolize (to generate ltmain.sh)
  c. Run automake --add-missing (to generate Makefile.in, config.guess,
     config.sub, depcomp, install-sh and missing)
  d. Run autoconf (to generate configure)

2. (Once) Configure : run ./configure (to generate Makefile and config.h)

3. Compile / recompile : make

4. Install : make install

Usage
=====

httpostfs <httpostfssite> <mountpoint>

ex.:
httpostfs http://fs.example.com/fs.php sunet/

where fs.php is e.g. like ../server-php/fs.php5

Debugging
=========

httpostfs -f -v -o debug,httpostfs_debug=3 <httpostfssite> <mountpoint> 

(runs the httpostfs in foreground and shows libcurl verbose debug output)
